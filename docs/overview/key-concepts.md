# Key Concepts

Understanding the core concepts of the Music API will help you build efficiently.

## Authentication

All API requests require a Basic authorisation.

## Resources

Our core resource is the **playlist**. Each playlist is associated with a user and can contain metadata like id, description, and song-ids.

## Pagination & Filtering

- Use query parameters to paginate large responses
- Filtering options are available on selected endpoints

## Errors

The API returns standardized HTTPS status codes with clear error messages to help you debug effectively.
